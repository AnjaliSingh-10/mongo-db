# MongoDB CRUD Operations

## Overview
This guide provides instructions on how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB in a Node.js environment. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible,
JSON-like documents. We will use the official MongoDB Node.js driver to interact with the database.

## Prerequisites
- MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or a MongoDB Atlas account.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js.

## Setup
1.Indexing: Use indexes to improve the performance of queries. Create indexes on fields that are frequently queried.

2.Schema Design: Even though MongoDB is schema-less, designing a schema that fits your use case can help improve performance and maintainability.

3.Data Validation: Use MongoDB's schema validation to enforce data integrity.

4.Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage database errors gracefully.

5.Connection Pooling: Use connection pooling to manage multiple database connections efficiently.

6.Security: Ensure your MongoDB instance is secure. Use authentication, IP whitelisting, and encryption where necessary.
